# Treatise on the Journey into the Black Hole

## Part 1: Introduction to the Narrative

The journey unfolds between two spacecraft:
- **Ship A**: the mother ship.
- **Ship B**: sets off toward the event horizon of the black hole.

From the point of view of **Ship A**, Ship B appears to slow down progressively as it nears the event horizon. The perception is one of infinite deceleration: the movements of the pilots on B appear slower and slower until they seem to freeze.

From the point of view of **Ship B**, however, everything proceeds normally. The pilots perceive no internal slowing, but they notice that time on Ship A flows anomalously: days, years, and millennia pass while only hours elapse for them.

---

## Part 2: Clocks and Relative Time

- At exactly 2:00 PM, the pilot of Ship A waves goodbye to the pilot of Ship B.
- After four hours of travel for Ship B:
  - The clock on Ship A marks the exact same time, including seconds, but the clock on B perceives that A is days ahead.
  - The closer B gets to the horizon, the more time on A accelerates: days become years, then millennia.

This is the first apparent incongruity:
- Science indicates that **the local observer B notices no difference** in their own time.
- Space around B contracts more and more, yet **the ship undergoes no compression or densification of matter**.
- The infinite density of the singularity remains theoretical; for the moment, B has not yet reached the event horizon.

## Part 4: Extreme Travel and Absolute Dilation

- After **eight hours of travel** for Ship B toward the horizon:
  - The distortion of space-time has become extreme.
  - From Ship B’s point of view, **billions upon billions of years have passed** in the entire universe.
  - The universe observed by B no longer exists in its original form: stars and galaxies have vanished, vaporized.

- As they move even closer to the horizon:
  - Those billions of billions become **billions of billions of billions of years**.
  - The universe has already reached its **heat death**. All matter and energy are dispersed.

- Despite this, **Ship B continues to travel normally**, without perceiving internal acceleration or material compression.
  - The difference between **local ship time** and **universal time observed from afar** reaches its maximum, showing the extreme limit of gravitational time dilation.

- As it nears the event horizon, time for the ship becomes increasingly dilated.
- If one were to touch the horizon, even for an infinitesimal fraction of its local time, it corresponds to **infinite time** for the external universe.
- This concept challenges understanding: local time continues normally, but the external reference becomes inconceivable.
- We remain within scientific rigor: at the event horizon, time theoretically flows to infinity; therefore, the idea of "going beyond" is only comprehensible from the local point of view of the ship.

- Once the hypothetical event horizon is reached, the ship **perceives no change**: everything appears normal for local observer B.
- Theoretically, external time becomes infinite, and the external universe may have already vaporized, but for B, only a few hours have passed.
- If the ship were to proceed beyond the horizon, **it would not undergo compression or densification**: local distances remain normal, contrary to the classical prediction of matter packing together.
- This is the incongruity: physics predicts a singularity of infinite density, but the local observer notices no alteration to their ship.

### Distortion of space near the event horizon

- Ship B approaches the event horizon of a black hole.
- The space-time distortion is such that, for B, local space **does not behave normally**.
- As B approaches, what seems to shrink to an external observer is perceived by B as **space that stretches**.
- The closer the ship gets to the horizon, the more the remaining distance toward it **increases**.
- Consequently, even by approaching infinitely, Ship B **never actually reaches the event horizon**.
- This phenomenon explains why, although theoretically possible, the event horizon **cannot be touched** by Ship B, remaining consistent with the extreme time dilation observed.

### Matter falling into the black hole

1. **External observer**
   - Falling matter appears to **slow down progressively** as it nears the event horizon.
   - It "never touches" the horizon: events slow down until they appear frozen and become increasingly red (extreme redshift).
   - Apparently suspended at the threshold, matter seems "still" at the horizon.

2. **Local observer (Ship B or falling object)**
   - Locally, matter **falls normally** without perceiving infinite slowing or infinite compression.
   - Traditionally, according to general relativity, it crosses the horizon and heads toward the singularity.
   - With space-time dilation considered: **local space stretches as one approaches the horizon**, so for the falling object, the horizon always appears "one step ahead" and is never reached.

3. **Collapse of the star or compact object**
   - The hypothetical neutron star collapses under gravity: for the external observer, the black hole forms gradually, with matter getting closer and closer to the horizon.
   - Locally, matter continues to fall toward the center without immediate accumulation.
   - **Scientific narrative conclusion**: matter falls, but thanks to the stretching of local space, the event horizon **is never actually touched**, and the singularity remains a theoretical limit, not a physical point tangible to those falling.

### Collision with the singularity and fundamental analogies

- Matter falling toward the black hole **cannot reach the event horizon**.
- The singularity is considered a theoretical limit with **finite density**; however, locally, matter fails to touch the horizon.

- **Conceptual parallels:**
  1. **Speed of light**: no object with mass can reach it.
  2. **Absolute zero**: no system can reach the temperature of 0 K.
  3. **Event horizon**: no matter can touch it.

- In all three cases, these are **fundamental limits imposed by physical laws**: they would require infinite energy or time, and thus **matter always remains infinitely close without ever crossing the limit**.

# Singularity: calculation error or logical error?

## Key Point
The **calculations regarding the singularity are correct**, but the **physical conclusion drawn from them is not**.
Infinite density is **not a real prediction**; it is a **signal that the model has stopped working**.

---

## Why does physics speak of infinite density?

The standard reasoning is as follows:

1. General Relativity is used to its limits.
2. Matter is treated as **continuous and compressible without thresholds**.
3. Equations are pushed until $r \to 0$.

**Mathematical result:**
- volume → 0
- finite mass
- density → ∞

✔ Matematicamente coerente
✘ Fisicamente non garantito

---

## The real error is not in the math
The error is **conceptual**, not mathematical.

When an infinity appears in physics:
- it is not an answer
- it is a **signal of model breakdown**

An infinity indicates:
> “Here the equations no longer describe physical reality.”

---

## The "Singularity Patch"
To say that:
> “the laws of physics work differently here”

actually means:
> “we don’t know what happens, but we call it a singularity.”

It is a **theoretical license**, not a physical explanation.

---

## The fundamental logical incongruity

Modern physics accepts that:
- the **speed of light** is not reachable
- **absolute zero** is not reachable
- the **event horizon** cannot be touched in finite time

All these limits are **asymptotic**.

Yet it is accepted without question that:
- **density can become infinite**

This is logically inconsistent.

---

## The correct parallel
Reaching a singularity with infinite density is conceptually identical to:
- reaching the speed of light
- reaching absolute zero
- touching the event horizon

These are **the same type of physical impossibility**.

---

## Conclusion
- ❌ The singularity is not an observable physical reality.
- ✅ It is an indicator of the model's limit.
- ❌ Infinite density is not a property of the universe.
- ✅ It is a property of the equations used beyond their domain.

The singularity does not explain the universe:
**it only signals that a deeper theory is needed.**

---

## Fundamental Clarification

The central point is not:
“time passes to infinity, therefore I cannot reach the event horizon.”

This is because, from the perspective of local observer B on board the ship,
proper time flows normally: only a few hours may have passed.

Therefore, proper time **is not the obstacle** to reaching the horizon.
This must be explicitly clarified, as it is often a source of confusion.

---

## Where the impossibility of touching the horizon actually arises

The impossibility does not arise from time, but from the **geometric structure of space-time**.

When approaching the event horizon:
- for the external observer, radial distances appear increasingly compressed;
- for the local observer, the opposite happens: the proper distance to the horizon **dilates**.

This is not a linguistic artifice, but a direct consequence of the relativistic metric.

The closer the local observer gets, the more the event horizon
“moves forward” in their reference system.

---

## Key conceptual formula

It does not happen that:
> “mi avvicino → resta meno spazio” (I move closer → less space remains)

but:
> “mi avvicino → lo spazio residuo si dilata” (I move closer → the remaining space dilates).

It follows that:
- it is possible to get arbitrarily close to the horizon;
- it is possible to make the coordinate distance smaller and smaller;
- but the proper distance never vanishes.

There is always more space to travel.

---

## Consistency with Relativity

This description does not contradict Relativity but strictly follows its principles.

Relativity establishes that:
- local measurements always remain regular;
- singularities emerge when a global description is forced as if it were local.

Refusing to attribute physical reality to a purely perspectival compression
does not violate the theory: it is a correct use of the theory.

---

## The structural parallel with other physical limits

This situation is formally analogous to:
- the limit of the speed of light;
- the limit of absolute zero temperature.

In all these cases:
- one can indefinitely approach the limit;
- the effects become increasingly extreme;
- but the limit is never reached locally.

Not because it is “forbidden,” but because the limit is **asymptotic**, not physical.

---

## Origin of the idea of infinite density

The idea of a singularity with infinite density arises from a logical error, not a mathematical one.

The implicit step is:
1. observing a coordinate compression (external point of view);
2. interpreting it as a real compression of matter;
3. concluding infinite density.

But Relativity does not authorize this step without comparison with the local frame.

---

## Perspective error: the New York analogy

It is the same error one would make observing New York:
- from up close as a vast luminous expanse;
- from far away as a point.

Concludere che New York sia diventata infinitamente densa (Concluding that New York has become infinitely dense) would be an obvious perspective error.

Attribuire densità infinita alla materia sulla base di una compressione apparente (Attributing infinite density to matter based on apparent compression) reproduces the same conceptual error.

---

## Synthesis

The singularity is not an inevitable prediction of Relativity, but the result of a non-critical extension of a perspectival description beyond the domain in which it possesses physical meaning.

The calculations remain correct; it is the ontological interpretation that is not justified.

---

# Principle of Self-Conservation of Matter

The first thing we can observe, in light of what has been discussed so far, is that the universe appears **self-conservative**: matter tends to maintain its internal coherence and does not allow for the reaching of limits that would nullify its physical state.

As we have already seen for the **event horizon**, for **absolute temperature**, and for the **speed of light**, these limits do not present themselves as barriers to cross, but as **asymptotes** that can be indefinitely approached without ever being reached locally.

---

## Extreme limits and loss of matter

This suggests a general principle:
it is not that physics “prohibits” certain extreme states, but that **reaching them would mean losing the very concept of matter**.
A system that actually reached one of these limits would cease to be describable as a coherent physical system.

---

## Critique of the traditional singularity

In this framework, the traditional idea that beyond the event horizon matter would inevitably collapse into a singularity of infinite density becomes problematic. Not because the calculations are wrong, but because the interpretation assumes as real what arises from a purely perspectival description. One takes a coordinate compression, observed from an external point of view, and transforms it into a local physical compression.

This is where the **conceptual error** emerges: relativity always requires the comparison between points of view, as in the twin paradox. Ignoring the local observer means attributing ontological reality to a representational effect. It is the same error one would make by observing a city from increasing distances and concluding that, because the image is reduced to a point, the city has become infinitely dense.

---

## Holographic screens and “mystical” interpretations

In this sense, even the interpretation of the event horizon as a two-dimensional **holographic screen** appears as a sophisticated solution to a problem that arises more from interpretation than from physics itself. It introduces an almost mystical element to save information, when a simpler explanation is already available: matter never reaches that limit locally, and therefore never collapses into a physical singularity in the naive sense of the term.

---

## Conceptual Synthesis

The singularity, as it is often presented, is not an **inevitable necessity** of general relativity, but the result of a non-critical extension of a global description beyond the domain in which it has physical meaning. The math may remain correct; it is the ontological interpretation that requires caution.

---

## Observation on the singularity and the photon

If we were able to cross the event horizon and enter a black hole, would we find ourselves in the same “place” as any other black hole? Beyond the horizon lies the singularity, which — according to the hypothesis — has not undergone symmetry breaks compatible with energy conservation. The vacuum does not undergo a symmetry break but a separation into two opposites, and we live inside this singularity, where we map a space-time grid. The photon, which has zero proper time, is present throughout the entire universe from its own point of view (like that of a spacecraft): in the singularity, devoid of space and time, **the photon is therefore “still” in its non-space. It is we who move and perceive its motion**, and with our observation, we cause the wave function to collapse. In practice, our position enters as a parameter in its wave function, just like in a mathematical function: if $f(x) = 2x$, then $2x$ would represent all possible positions of the photon (a line), while we are a dot observing a point on that line as we move.

**Searching for the star with infinite density inside the non-space of the black hole therefore makes little sense since it is the same non-space of every black hole. Any observed vacuum is always the same vacuum, the same timeless non-place.**

---

## Conclusion

That said, the discussion can stop here as a **first conceptual closure**: what follows is no longer a demonstration, but a series of considerations on what a black hole actually becomes if one takes relativity and the principle of matter coherence seriously to the very end.

If one managed to go beyond the event horizon
